Due to not being able to mount the image properly I was unable to get the correct data in the places.sqlite file inside mozila folder.
When I finally mounted the image properly I was able to get the 5 mb places.sqlite file.

It was not accessible at first then I used the command 

sudo chown -R "$USER":"$USER" ./

It gave me the required permission to access the file and I obtained a line in the moz_places table

I converted the timestamp in seconds which gave me value 1694294507

The answer then after using the given format was

SICTF{https://www.home.cern/totally-legit-time-travel-guide_1694294507} // Probably the answer.
