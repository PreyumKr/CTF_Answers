It was a program or executable.
When I executed the program, it asked for a password by saying " Enter the password :"

I opened the executable file in a text editor (i.e VS Code ) and did a find search for the string.
The answer was written just after the string in the middle of the program's code.

 Enter the password :  MY Super Stronk Password, which is completely unbreakable and you could never guess in a milion years. #guessinggames #systummm #smort #200millionIQ 
 Wrong Password  
 Correct Password       
 SICTF{br0k3n_h34r75_4nd_m3nd3d_5y573m5}

 It literally gave the answer right there.
