In this I used notepad++.
I observed that every zip file was like a enclosure and each zip's data was contained in the start and end of the file.
The data looked like PK ETX EOT in the start and PK ENO ACK in the end.

Now I looked at the middle (i.e the last zipped file) of the file and found a name flag.txtUT. So, since it was in the middle its enclosing folder was also just one enclosure away from it. 

So, I kept the text begining from PK ETX 7qehc8ehw8.zip and ending with 7qehc8ehw8.zip PK ENO ACK.
I removed everything else from the file and saved it.

Then when I extraxted the zip file I got the flag.txt file inside the 7qehc8ehw8 folder.

The flag.txt file contained the exact answer without any hashing. i.e.
SICTF{17_6035_0n_4nd_0n_4nd_0n}  // It goes on and on and on...
