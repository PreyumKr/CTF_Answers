I ran a check in the var/log folder for firefox, like

cat * | grep firefox

and got a log like this.

Sep  9 21:19:51 futureman authpriv.info : emmettbrown ran command apk add firefox as root from /home/emmettbrown

Converting the timestamp in the epoch time converter and giving the year as 2023.
I got the value 1694294391

The answer then after using the given format was

SICTF{1694294391} //probably
