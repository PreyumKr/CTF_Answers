In the var log, just ran

cat * | grep passwd

It gave me the log like this.

Sep  9 20:38:58 futureman auth.info passwd: password for emmettbrown changed by root

I was confused whether the time showed the year or not, but then realised there was no year and only date month and time
in HH:MM:SS format.
Converted it in the epoch time converter and obtained 1694291938 value.

The answer then after using the given format was

SICTF{1694291938} // Probably the answer.
