I used steghide for this.
When I wrote the command and gave password as null by pressing enter it gave me a file named flag.

preyumkr@ASUS-TUF17:/mnt/d/Study Material/IITGN/Workshop$ steghide extract -sf Oppenheimer.jpg
Enter passphrase:
the file "flag" does already exist. overwrite ? (y/n) n
steghide: did not write to file "flag".

The flag file had a hash which I decrypted using a webpage that said it can decrypt any kind of hashes.

webpage: https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash

The page gave a output like this.

U0lDVEZ7MV80TV84M0MwTTNfRDM0N0hfN0gzX0QzNTdyMFkzcl8wRl9XMHIxRDV9:SICTF{1_4M_83C0M3_D347H_7H3_D357r0Y3r_0F_W0r1D5}

Which had the answer directly.
SICTF{1_4M_83C0M3_D347H_7H3_D357r0Y3r_0F_W0r1D5}
